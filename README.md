# NZBAir - Legacy Android Application for NewsNab Integration

This repository contains the source code for **NZBAir**, a legacy Android application I developed years ago. The app integrates with NewsNab endpoints (and several others) to let users quickly view and push NZB files to their **SABnzbd** server.

Originally a paid application (still live on the store), I'm releasing the code as a nod to my inner *"WTF-per-minute"* monologue. Built during the early days of Android development, this project showcases the creative ~~hacks~~ *workarounds* required to overcome the platform's limitations back then.

## üìú About the Code
- **Platform:** Early Android SDK.
- **Features:**  
  - Integration with NewsNab endpoints.  
  - Easy NZB file management.  
  - Compatibility with SABnzbd servers.  
- **Purpose:** Released to share a glimpse of Android development history and offer a learning opportunity for fellow developers.

## üåê Original Homepage
For more information about the app and its original purpose, check out the [NZBAir homepage](https://www.milesburton.com/w/NZBAir_-_Usenet_and_SABnzbd_mobile_for_Android).

## üöÄ Future Plans
A newer version of NZBAir exists, updated to the latest Android SDK (which is significantly easier to work with now). However, I never released it publicly. 

If I revisit this project in the future, I'll likely rewrite it using **React Native** for its cross-platform benefits and reduced development effort.

## ü§î Why Release This?
- To share a slice of Android development history.
- To reflect on the evolution of Android development and its quirks.
- To inspire and engage developers who enjoy exploring legacy projects.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
Feel free to explore the codebase and adapt it as needed. Note that this project reflects development practices and tools from an earlier era of Android development.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This is legacy code and may not follow modern best practices. Use it as a reference, for inspiration, or simply to reminisce about the early days of Android development.

## ‚ú® Enjoy NZBAir!
Explore, learn, and enjoy the nostalgia! If you have feedback, suggestions, or just want to share your thoughts, feel free to get in touch.
