# NZBAir

## Description
A legacy Android application I wrote many years ago to integrate with NewsNab endpoints (and a bunch of others) so users can quickly view and push NZB files to their SABNZB server.

Originally a paid for application (which is still live), I'm releasing the code to satisfy my inner WTF/per-minute monologue. Written right back in the early days of Android, so it's interesting to see the various ~~hacks~~ *workarounds* I wrote to get around the limitations.

A new version does exist, with this ported to the latest SDK (which is a ton easier to write for). However I've never pushed it live, instead if I choose to revisit this application I'll probably just write it in ReactNative which would be a ton less work. 

Enjoy NZBAir, and remember
